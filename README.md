# js-utils

My assortment of common utils that I've grown tired of copy pasting to every repo I create.

## Development

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
3. Compile, e.g. `bun compile node -f cjs`, `bun compile bun`, `bun compile browser`
